I created a Python function called fizz_buzz that takes an integer n as input and uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to n. Inside the loop, I used conditional statements to check whether the current number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. If it is a multiple of both, the function prints "FizzBuzz". Otherwise, it prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3 and "Buzz" for multiples of 5. If the current number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, it simply prints the number itself.

In terms of trade-offs, my approach prioritizes simplicity and readability over performance. The function uses a simple for loop and conditional statements to solve the problem, which is easy to understand and modify if needed. However, this approach may not be the most efficient if we are dealing with very large ranges of numbers, as we are checking each number individually for divisibility. For larger ranges, a more optimized approach might involve using mathematical formulas or bitwise operations to check for divisibility in a more efficient way.

Overall, my approach to the FizzBuzz problem strikes a balance between simplicity and performance, and is suitable for small to medium-sized ranges of numbers.
